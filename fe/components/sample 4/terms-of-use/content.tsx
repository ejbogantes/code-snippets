      <h2>Description Of the Services</h2>

      <p>

        any prior agreements between both of us with respect to the Platform. You also may be subject to additional
        terms and conditions that may apply when you use or purchase certain other services, affiliate services, third
        party content, or third-party software. The foregoing does not apply to Sponsors who are subject to separate
        Sponsor Agreements.
      </p>

      <h2>Choice of Law and Forum</h2>

      <p>
        This TOS and the relationship between both of us shall be exclusively governed by the laws of the United States
        and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Your exclusive forum for
        bringing any claim or cause of action against us is the courts located in Boston, Massachusetts. You hereby
        accept and submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any proceeding or action. With
        respect to any such proceeding or action brought in such courts, you hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest
        extent permitted by law: (a) any objection you may have now or in the future to such jurisdiction or venue, and
        (b) any claim that such action or proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient form. Nothing limits our right
        to commence and prosecute any legal or equitable action or proceeding before any court of competent jurisdiction
        to obtain injunctive or any other form of relief.
      </p>

      <h2>Arbitration</h2>

      <p>
        Notwithstanding anything herein, if we elect in our sole discretion to resolve any claim through arbitration,
        you must cooperate fully with and be bound by such arbitration, without further recourse of any kind. The
        American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) shall preside over such arbitration. Such arbitration shall be
        exclusively governed by the laws of the United States and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without regard to
        its conflict of law provisions. All proceedings shall take place in Boston, Massachusetts. If there is a
        conflict between the rules of the AAA and any provision of this TOS, this TOS shall govern. You are responsible
        for all costs that you incur in the arbitration, including without limitation, expert witnesses or attorneys.
        The reasonable filing fees and arbitrator’s costs and expenses shall be advanced by us. However, if the
        arbitration is decided in our favor, you must reimburse us for all of our fees, costs, and expenses related to
        the arbitration, including without limitation, all fees, costs, and expenses related to filing, arbitrators,
        expert witnesses, attorneys, and other third parties.
      </p>

      <h2>Waiver and Severability of Terms</h2>

      <p>
        We do not waive our rights by delaying or failing to exercise them at any time. If any provision of this TOS
        shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable under any rule, law, or regulation of any local, state, or
        federal governmental agency, the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this TOS shall not be
        affected, and the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force and effect.
      </p>

      <h2>No Third-Party Beneficiaries</h2>

      <p>
        Except as otherwise expressly provided in this TOS, there shall be no third party beneficiaries to this TOS.
      </p>

      <h2>No Right of Survivorship and Non-Transferability</h2>

      <p>
        Your right of access to the Platform is non-transferable and any rights to information we store with respect to
        your usage terminates upon your death or dissolution.
      </p>

      <h2>Statute of Limitations</h2>

      <p>
        Notwithstanding any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to
        use of the Platform or this TOS must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or
        be forever barred.
      </p>

      <h2>Section Headings</h2>

      <p>The section titles in this TOS are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</p>

      <h2>Claims of Copyright and Trademark Infringement</h2>

        infringement, please provide our Designated Agent (set forth below) the following information (as required by
        Section 512©(3) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act):
      </p>
      <ul className={styles.list}>
        <li className={styles.list}>
          Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a
          single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;
        </li>
        <li className={styles.list}>
          Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity
          and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to
          permit us to locate the material on our Platform;{' '}
        </li>
        <li className={styles.list}>
          Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if
          available, an electronic mail address;
        </li>
        <li className={styles.list}>
          A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not
          authorized by you, your agent, or the law; and
        </li>
        <li className={styles.list}>
          A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are
          authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

      <p>
        The information specified above must be sent to our Designated Agent, whose contact information is as follows:

      <p>
        Please note that Section 512(f) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act may impose liability for damages on any
        person who knowingly sends meritless notices of infringement. Please do not make false claims. Any information
        or correspondence that you provide may be shared with third parties, including the person who provided the
        allegedly infringing material. Upon receipt of a bona fide infringement notification by the Designated Agent, we
        will remove or disable access to the infringing material, notify the user that it has removed or disabled access
        to the material, and, for repeat offenders, to terminate such user’s access to the Platform.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you believe that your content should not have been removed for alleged copyright infringement, you may send
        our Designated Agent a written counter-notice with the following information:
      </p>
      <ul className={styles.list}>
        <li className={styles.list}>
          Identification of the copyrighted work that was removed, and the location on the Platform where it would have
          been found prior to its removal;
        </li>
        <li className={styles.list}>
          A statement, under penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed as a
          result of a mistake or misidentification; and
        </li>
        <li className={styles.list}>
          Your physical or electronic signature, together with your contact information (address, telephone number and,
          if available, email address).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, we may send a copy of the counter-notice to the
        original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed material or cease disabling it
        in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the user, the
        removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the
        counter-notice, at our discretion.
